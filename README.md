# 🔌 Arduino Basics: LED & Pushbutton Projects

 This project contains simple starter exercises using the **Arduino Mega** that helped me learn the fundamentals of Arduino programming and hardware. 
 

Arduino, the family of open-source single-board microcontrollers, can power a variety of complex projects like DYI VR gloves 🧤. This project is based on the foundational concepts taught by **Zara Khalil**, who walks through how to wire up components and program basic Arduino functions.
